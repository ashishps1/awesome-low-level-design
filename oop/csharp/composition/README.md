# Composition in C#

## Introduction

Composition is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows objects to be built using other objects, promoting code reuse, flexibility, and better maintainability. Unlike inheritance, which establishes an "is-a" relationship, composition represents a "has-a" relationship.

## What is Composition?

Composition is a design principle in OOP where one class contains an instance (or instances) of another class as a field. The contained class is often called a component, and the containing class is referred to as a composite class. This helps in building complex systems by combining simpler objects.

### Example: A Car and its Components

Consider a `Car` that consists of multiple components like an `Engine`, `Wheel`, and `Transmission`. Instead of inheriting from these components, a `Car` object will contain them as fields.

```csharp
using System;

class Engine
{
    private int horsepower;
    
    public Engine(int horsepower)
    {
        this.horsepower = horsepower;
    }

    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Engine started with {horsepower} HP.");
    }
}

class Wheel
{
    private string type;
    
    public Wheel(string type)
    {
        this.type = type;
    }

    public void Rotate()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The {type} wheel is rotating.");
    }
}

class Transmission
{
    private string type;
    
    public Transmission(string type)
    {
        this.type = type;
    }

    public void ShiftGear()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Transmission shifted: {type}");
    }
}

class Car
{
    private Engine engine;
    private Wheel wheel;
    private Transmission transmission;

    public Car(Engine engine, Wheel wheel, Transmission transmission)
    {
        this.engine = engine;
        this.wheel = wheel;
        this.transmission = transmission;
    }

    public void Drive()
    {
        engine.Start();
        wheel.Rotate();
        transmission.ShiftGear();
        Console.WriteLine("Car is moving!");
    }
}

class CompositionExample
{
    static void Main()
    {   
        Car car = new Car(new Engine(150), new Wheel("Alloy"), new Transmission("Automatic"));
        car.Drive();
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Engine started with 150 HP.
The Alloy wheel is rotating.
Transmission shifted: Automatic
Car is moving!
```

## Why Prefer Composition Over Inheritance?

### 1. **Encapsulation and Flexibility**
   - Composition allows us to change the behavior of an object dynamically by replacing components at runtime.
   - Inheritance makes it difficult to modify an existing class hierarchy without breaking existing code.

### 2. **Better Code Reusability**
   - Composition promotes reusable components. The `Engine`, `Wheel`, and `Transmission` classes can be used in multiple types of vehicles (Car, Bike, Truck) without modification.

### 3. **Avoids Inheritance Pitfalls**
   - Inheritance can lead to deep class hierarchies, making maintenance difficult.
   - It enforces strict parent-child relationships, which can be too rigid for some designs.

### 4. **Supports Interface-Based Design**
   - Composition can be combined with interfaces to achieve powerful decoupling.

## Composition with Interfaces

Using interfaces with composition allows for greater flexibility and loose coupling.

```csharp
using System;

interface IEngine
{
    void Start();
}

class PetrolEngine : IEngine
{
    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Petrol Engine started.");
    }
}

class DieselEngine : IEngine
{
    public void Start()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Diesel Engine started.");
    }
}

class Car
{
    private IEngine engine;

    public Car(IEngine engine)
    {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void StartCar()
    {
        engine.Start();
        Console.WriteLine("Car is ready to go!");
    }
}

class InterfaceCompositionExample
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Car petrolCar = new Car(new PetrolEngine());
        petrolCar.StartCar();
        
        Car dieselCar = new Car(new DieselEngine());
        dieselCar.StartCar();
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Petrol Engine started.
Car is ready to go!
Diesel Engine started.
Car is ready to go!
```

## When to Use Composition?

- When building complex objects that consist of multiple components.
- When you want to achieve **code reusability** without rigid inheritance hierarchies.
- When different behaviors need to be swapped dynamically (e.g., using different types of engines in a vehicle).
- When following the **favor composition over inheritance** principle.
