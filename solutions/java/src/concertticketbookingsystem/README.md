# Concert Ticket Booking System (LLD)

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a Concert Ticket Booking System that allows users to book seats for concerts. The system should manage concert details, seat availability, and handle bookings with proper validation.

---

## Requirements

- **Concert Management:** The system manages concert details including name, date, venue, and available seats.
- **Seat Management:** The system tracks different types of seats (VIP, STANDARD, ECONOMY) and their availability.
- **Booking Management:** Users can book seats, and the system handles booking status (CONFIRMED, CANCELLED).
- **User Management:** The system maintains user information for bookings.
- **Validation:** The system prevents double bookings and handles seat availability checks.

---

## Core Entities

- **ConcertTicketBookingSystem:** Main class that manages concerts, bookings, and seat allocation.
- **Concert:** Represents a concert with its details and seat management.
- **Seat:** Represents a seat with its type, status, and booking information.
- **User:** Represents a user who can book tickets.
- **Booking:** Represents a booking with its status and associated details.
- **SeatType:** Enum for different seat categories (VIP, STANDARD, ECONOMY).
- **SeatStatus:** Enum for seat states (AVAILABLE, BOOKED).
- **BookingStatus:** Enum for booking states (CONFIRMED, CANCELLED).
