# Ride Sharing Service (LLD)

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a Ride Sharing Service that allows riders to request rides, drivers to accept trips, and the system to manage trip assignments, payments, and trip status.

---

## Requirements

- **User Management:** The system manages both riders and drivers.
- **Location Management:** The system tracks the current location of drivers and riders.
- **Trip Request:** Riders can request rides by specifying pickup and drop-off locations.
- **Driver Assignment:** The system assigns available drivers to ride requests based on proximity and availability.
- **Trip Management:** The system tracks the status of each trip (e.g., REQUESTED, ONGOING, COMPLETED, CANCELLED).
- **Payment Processing:** The system processes payments for completed trips.
- **Driver Status:** The system tracks driver availability (e.g., AVAILABLE, ON_TRIP, OFFLINE).
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new features such as ratings, ride pooling, or surge pricing.

## Example Usage

```java
RideSharingService service = new RideSharingService();
Rider alice = new Rider(1, "Alice", new Location(12.9716, 77.5946));
Driver bob = new Driver(2, "Bob", new Location(12.9718, 77.5940), DriverStatus.AVAILABLE);

service.registerRider(alice);
service.registerDriver(bob);

Trip trip = service.requestTrip(alice, alice.getCurrentLocation(), new Location(12.9352, 77.6245));
service.assignDriver(trip);
service.startTrip(trip);
// ... after trip completion
Payment payment = new Payment(1, 250.0, "CREDIT_CARD");
service.completeTrip(trip);
service.processPayment(trip, payment);
```
