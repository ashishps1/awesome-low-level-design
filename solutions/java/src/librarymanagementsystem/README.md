# Library Management System (LLD)

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a Library Management System that allows members to borrow and return books, manages book inventory, tracks loans, and supports catalog search.

## Requirements

- **Book Management:** The system manages a catalog of books, each with multiple copies.
- **Member Management:** The system manages library members who can borrow and return books.
- **Loan Management:** The system tracks which member has borrowed which book copy and when.
- **Borrowing and Returning:** Members can borrow available book copies and return them.
- **Catalog Search:** Members can search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new features such as reservations, fines, or notifications.
