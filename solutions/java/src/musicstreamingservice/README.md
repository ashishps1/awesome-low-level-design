## Design Patterns Used

- **Singleton Pattern:** For `MusicLibrary`, `UserManager`, and `MusicRecommender` to ensure a single instance.
---

## Example Usage

```java
MusicStreamingService service = new MusicStreamingService();
service.initialize();

User alice = service.getUserManager().registerUser("alice", "password");
Artist artist = new Artist(1, "The Beatles");
Album album = new Album(1, "Abbey Road", artist);
Song song = new Song(1, "Come Together", artist, album, 259);

service.getLibrary().addArtist(artist);
service.getLibrary().addAlbum(album);
service.getLibrary().addSong(song);

alice.getPlaylists().add(new Playlist(1, "Favorites"));
alice.getPlaylists().get(0).addSong(song);

service.getPlayer().play(song);
```

## Demo

See `MusicStreamingServiceDemo.java` for a sample usage and simulation of the music streaming service.

## Extending the Framework

- **Add social features:** Allow users to share playlists or follow each other.
- **Add offline playback:** Support downloading songs for offline listening.
- **Add collaborative playlists:** Allow multiple users to edit a playlist.
