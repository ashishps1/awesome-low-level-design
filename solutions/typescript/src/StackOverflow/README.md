# StackOverflow System (LLD)

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a simplified StackOverflow-like Q&A platform. The system should allow users to post questions and answers, vote on them, comment, tag questions, and track user reputation.

## Requirements

- **User Management:** Users can ask questions, answer, comment, and vote.
- **Questions & Answers:** Users can post questions and answers. Each question can have multiple answers, and one accepted answer.
- **Voting:** Users can upvote or downvote questions and answers. Reputation is updated accordingly.
- **Comments:** Users can comment on both questions and answers.
- **Tags:** Questions can be tagged for categorization.
- **Reputation:** Users gain or lose reputation based on votes and accepted answers.
- **Accepted Answer:** The question author can mark one answer as accepted.

---

## Core Entities

- **User:** Represents a user, tracks reputation and user details.
- **Question:** Represents a question, holds answers, comments, tags, votes, and accepted answer.
- **Answer:** Represents an answer to a question, holds comments, votes, and accepted status.
- **Comment:** Represents a comment on a question or answer.
- **Tag:** Represents a tag for categorizing questions.
- **Vote:** Represents a vote (upvote/downvote) by a user on a question or answer.
- **VoteType:** Enum for UPVOTE and DOWNVOTE.
- **Votable (interface):** For entities that can be voted on.
- **Commentable (interface):** For entities that can be commented on.

## Example Usage

```ts
const stackOverflow = StackOverflow.getInstance();
const alice = stackOverflow.createUser("Alice", "alice@example.com");
const q = stackOverflow.postQuestion(alice, "What is JavaScript?", "Explain JavaScript basics.", ["javascript", "basics"]);
const bob = stackOverflow.createUser("Bob", "bob@example.com");
const a = stackOverflow.postAnswer(bob.getUserId(), q.getId(), "JavaScript is a programming language.");
stackOverflow.vote(bob.getUserId(), q, VoteTypeEnum.UPVOTE);
stackOverflow.acceptAnswer(a.getId());
```

## Demo

## Extending the Framework

- **Add new features:** Such as badges, user profiles, or advanced search.
- **Add new vote types:** Extend `VoteType` and update logic in `vote()` methods.
- **Add moderation:** Implement admin/moderator roles for content management.
