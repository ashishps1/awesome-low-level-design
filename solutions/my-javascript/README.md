# Notes

1. public, private, protected
   1. public - by default, dont need to do anything
   2. private - (#variable) accessible only within same class
   3. protected - (_variable) not actively enforeced by JS (technically public)
   4. however, they cannot be used on the class fields, they can only be used on the class methods
2. enums
   1. no "enum" type to declare with, just use plain object
3. abstract
   1. no "abstract" classes, use an error-handler function within constructor instead
4.
