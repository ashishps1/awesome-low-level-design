## Design Patterns

üìñ **Difficulty**: Varies | ‚è±Ô∏è **Estimated Time**: 2-5 hours per pattern category

Design patterns are reusable, well-tested solutions to commonly occurring problems within a given context in software design. They are not specific algorithms or code but rather general concepts or templates that can be implemented in various ways depending on the programming language and the specific problem.

**Why are Design Patterns Important?**

*   **Promote Reusability**: They provide proven solutions, saving time and effort.
*   **Improve Code Readability and Maintainability**: Using standard patterns makes code easier to understand for developers familiar with them.
*   **Provide a Common Language**: Developers can communicate more efficiently by referring to well-known patterns.
*   **Offer Well-Tested Solutions**: Patterns have often been used and refined over time, leading to more robust applications.

This section is organized into the three main categories of design patterns:

*   [Creational Patterns](#creational-patterns)
*   [Structural Patterns](#structural-patterns)
*   [Behavioral Patterns](#behavioral-patterns)

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

*   **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Creational%20Pattern/Factory%20Design%20Pattern/))
*   **Prototype**: Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Creational%20Pattern/Prototype%20Design%20Pattern/))

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe not just patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them.

#### Javascript

*   **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Behavioral%20Pattern/Mediator%20Design%20Pattern/))
*   **Memento**: Without violating encapsulation, captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Behavioral%20Pattern/Memento%20Design%20Pattern/))

*   **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Behavioral%20Pattern/State%20Design%20Pattern/))
*   **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Behavioral%20Pattern/Strategy%20Design%20Pattern/))
*   **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Behavioral%20Pattern/Template%20Design%20Pattern/))
*   **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. ([View Code](design-patterns/Javascript/Behavioral%20Pattern/Visitor%20Design%20Pattern/))

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

üí° **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate | ‚è±Ô∏è **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours per concept

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A key feature of objects is that an object's own procedures can access and often modify the data fields of itself.

**Core Principles of OOP:**

*   **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
*   **Encapsulation**: Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components.
*   **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behavior (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse.
*   **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name.

This section provides explanations and examples for these core OOP principles in various programming languages. Each concept has a `README.md` within its respective language directory that provides more detailed explanations and code examples.

---

### Abstraction

Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. It helps to manage complexity by focusing on what an object does instead of how it does it.

*   **C++**: ([View Readme](oop/cpp/abstraction/README.md)) - Learn how C++ achieves abstraction through abstract classes and access specifiers.
*   **C#**: ([View Readme](oop/csharp/abstraction/README.md)) - Explore abstraction using abstract classes, interfaces, and access modifiers in C#.
*   **Go**: ([View Readme](oop/golang/abstraction/README.md)) - Understand how Go implements abstraction using interfaces.
*   **Java**: ([View Readme](oop/java/abstraction/README.md)) - Discover abstraction in Java through abstract classes and interfaces.
*   **Python**: ([View Readme](oop/python/abstraction/README.md)) - See abstraction in Python using abstract base classes (ABCs) and duck typing.

---

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference and misuse of the methods and data.

*   **C++**: ([View Readme](oop/cpp/encapsulation/README.md)) - Understand encapsulation in C++ using access specifiers (public, private, protected).
*   **C#**: ([View Readme](oop/csharp/encapsulation/README.md)) - Learn about encapsulation in C# through properties and access modifiers.
*   **Go**: ([View Readme](oop/golang/encapsulation/README.md)) - Discover how Go achieves encapsulation through exported and unexported identifiers (using capitalization).
*   **Java**: ([View Readme](oop/java/encapsulation/README.md)) - Explore encapsulation in Java using access modifiers (public, private, protected, default) and getter/setter methods.
*   **Python**: ([View Readme](oop/python/encapsulation/README.md)) - See how Python implements encapsulation using name mangling (private members) and properties.

---

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept where a new class (derived or child class) acquires the properties and behaviors (methods) of an existing class (base or parent class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

*   **C++**: ([View Readme](oop/cpp/inheritance/README.md)) - Learn about different types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid) in C++.
*   **C#**: ([View Readme](oop/csharp/inheritance/README.md)) - Explore inheritance in C#, including single inheritance and interface implementation.
*   **Go**: ([View Readme](oop/golang/inheritance/README.md)) - Understand how Go achieves similar results to inheritance through embedding (composition).
*   **Java**: ([View Readme](oop/java/inheritance/README.md)) - Discover inheritance in Java, including single and multilevel inheritance, and the use of the `extends` keyword.
*   **Python**: ([View Readme](oop/python/inheritance/README.md)) - See how Python supports various forms of inheritance, including multiple inheritance.

---

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism (from Greek, meaning "many forms") allows objects of different classes to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways. This is typically achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism, where supported).

*   **C++**: ([View Readme](oop/cpp/polymorphism/README.md)) - Explore runtime polymorphism using virtual functions and compile-time polymorphism through function overloading and templates.
*   **C#**: ([View Readme](oop/csharp/polymorphism/README.md)) - Learn about runtime polymorphism with virtual and override keywords, and compile-time polymorphism via method overloading.
*   **Go**: ([View Readme](oop/golang/polymorphism/README.md)) - Understand how Go achieves polymorphism through interfaces.
*   **Java**: ([View Readme](oop/java/polymorphism/README.md)) - Discover runtime polymorphism using method overriding and compile-time polymorphism through method overloading.
*   **Python**: ([View Readme](oop/python/polymorphism/README.md)) - See polymorphism in Python through duck typing and method overriding.

## Learning Checklist/Roadmap

üó∫Ô∏è **Start Your Journey Here!**

This roadmap is designed to guide you through the concepts and patterns in this repository in a logical sequence. Feel free to jump around if you're already familiar with certain topics, but following this path can be helpful for a structured learning experience.

**Phase 1: Foundations - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

*Estimated Time: 4-8 hours*

1.  [ ] **Understanding Core OOP Principles**:
    *   [ ] **Classes and Objects**: The very basics. What are they? (Choose your language and find the `classesandobjects` README in the `oop/` directory)
        *   *Difficulty: Beginner*

        *   *Difficulty: Beginner*
    *   [ ] **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity, showing essentials. ([View OOP Concepts](#abstraction))
        *   *Difficulty: Beginner*
    *   [ ] **Inheritance**: Deriving classes from others. ([View OOP Concepts](#inheritance))
        *   *Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate*
    *   [ ] **Polymorphism**: Objects taking many forms. ([View OOP Concepts](#polymorphism))
        *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
2.  [ ] **Understanding Relationships and Structures**:
    *   [ ] **Association**: How objects interact. ([View OOP Concepts](#association))
        *   *Difficulty: Beginner*
    *   [ ] **Aggregation**: "Has-a" relationship (independent lifecycles). ([View OOP Concepts](#aggregation))
        *   *Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate*
    *   [ ] **Composition**: Strong "has-a" relationship (dependent lifecycles). ([View OOP Concepts](#composition))
        *   *Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate*
    *   [ ] **Interfaces**: Defining contracts. (Especially important in statically-typed languages, good to understand for all). ([View OOP Concepts](#interfaces))
        *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*

**Phase 2: Introduction to Design Patterns - Creational Patterns**

*Estimated Time: 5-10 hours (1-2 hours per pattern)*

*Focus: How objects are created.*

1.  [ ] **Singleton Pattern**: Ensuring a single instance. ([View Creational Patterns](#singleton))
    *   *Difficulty: Beginner*
2.  [ ] **Factory Method Pattern**: Deferring instantiation to subclasses. ([View Creational Patterns](#factory-method))
    *   *Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate*
3.  [ ] **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Creating families of related objects. ([View Creational Patterns](#abstract-factory))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
4.  [ ] **Builder Pattern**: Constructing complex objects step by step. ([View Creational Patterns](#builder))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
5.  [ ] **Prototype Pattern**: Cloning objects from a prototype. ([View Creational Patterns](#prototype))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*

**Phase 3: Structuring Your Code - Structural Patterns**

*Estimated Time: 6-12 hours (1-2 hours per pattern)*

*Focus: How classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.*

1.  [ ] **Adapter Pattern**: Making incompatible interfaces work together. ([View Structural Patterns](#adapter))
    *   *Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate*
2.  [ ] **Decorator Pattern**: Adding responsibilities to objects dynamically. ([View Structural Patterns](#decorator))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
3.  [ ] **Facade Pattern**: Simplifying a complex subsystem with a single interface. ([View Structural Patterns](#facade))
    *   *Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate*
4.  [ ] **Composite Pattern**: Treating individual objects and compositions uniformly. ([View Structural Patterns](#composite))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
5.  [ ] **Bridge Pattern**: Decoupling abstraction from implementation. ([View Structural Patterns](#bridge))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced*
6.  [ ] **Proxy Pattern**: Providing a surrogate or placeholder for another object. ([View Structural Patterns](#proxy))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
7.  [ ] **Flyweight Pattern**: Efficiently supporting large numbers of fine-grained objects. ([View Structural Patterns](#flyweight))
    *   *Difficulty: Advanced*

**Phase 4: Managing Behavior - Behavioral Patterns**

*Estimated Time: 8-15 hours (1-2 hours per pattern)*

*Focus: How objects interact and distribute responsibility.*

1.  [ ] **Strategy Pattern**: Defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#strategy))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
2.  [ ] **Observer Pattern**: Notifying multiple objects about state changes. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#observer))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
3.  [ ] **Command Pattern**: Encapsulating a request as an object. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#command))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
4.  [ ] **Template Method Pattern**: Defining an algorithm's skeleton, deferring steps to subclasses. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#template-method))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
5.  [ ] **Iterator Pattern**: Accessing elements of a collection sequentially. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#iterator))
    *   *Difficulty: Beginner-Intermediate*
6.  [ ] **State Pattern**: Allowing an object to change behavior when its state changes. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#state))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced*
7.  [ ] **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: Passing a request along a chain of handlers. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#chain-of-responsibility))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
8.  [ ] **Mediator Pattern**: Centralizing complex communications between objects. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#mediator))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced*
9.  [ ] **Memento Pattern**: Capturing and restoring an object's internal state. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#memento))
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate*
10. [ ] **Visitor Pattern**: Adding new operations to classes without modifying them. ([View Behavioral Patterns](#visitor))
    *   *Difficulty: Advanced*

**Phase 5: Applying Your Knowledge - Problems and Solutions**

*Estimated Time: Varies greatly*

*   [ ] Select problems from the [Problems and Solutions](#problems-and-solutions) section.
    *   Try to solve them on your own first.
    *   Then, review the provided solutions, paying attention to the OOP principles and design patterns used.
    *   *Difficulty: Intermediate to Advanced*

**Tips for Learning:**

*   **Hands-on Practice**: Don't just read! Try to implement the patterns and concepts yourself in your preferred language.
*   **Relate to Real-World Examples**: Think about how these patterns could apply to software you use or develop.
*   **Don't Memorize, Understand**: Focus on the *why* and *when* of using a pattern, not just its structure.
*   **Start Simple**: If a pattern seems too complex, review the foundational OOP concepts it builds upon.
*   **Contribute**: Explaining concepts to others (e.g., by contributing to this repo) is a great way to solidify your understanding.

This roadmap is a suggestion. Happy learning!
