## Classes, Interfaces and Enumerations
1. The **Song**, **Album**, and **Artist** classes represent the basic entities in the music streaming service, with properties such as ID, title, artist, album, duration, and relationships between them.
2. The **User** class represents a user of the music streaming service, with properties like ID, username, password, and a list of playlists.
3. The **Playlist** class represents a user-created playlist, containing a list of songs.
4. The **MusicLibrary** class serves as a central repository for storing and managing songs, albums, and artists. It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure a single instance of the music library.
5. The **UserManager** class handles user registration, login, and other user-related operations. It also follows the Singleton pattern.
6. The **MusicPlayer** class represents the music playback functionality, allowing users to play, pause, skip, and seek within songs.
7. The **MusicRecommender** class generates song recommendations based on user preferences and listening history. It follows the Singleton pattern.
8. The **MusicStreamingService** class is the main entry point of the music streaming service. It initializes the necessary components, handles user requests, and manages the overall functionality of the service.
