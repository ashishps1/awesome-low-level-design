## Classes, Interfaces and Enumerations
1. The **Customer** class represents a customer who can place orders. It contains customer details such as ID, name, email, and phone number.
2. The **Restaurant** class represents a restaurant that offers menu items. It contains restaurant details such as ID, name, address, and a list of menu items. It provides methods to add and remove menu items.
3. The **MenuItem** class represents an item on a restaurant's menu. It contains details such as ID, name, description, price, and availability status.
4. The **Order** class represents an order placed by a customer. It contains order details such as ID, customer, restaurant, list of order items, status, and assigned delivery agent. It provides methods to add and remove order items, update order status, and assign a delivery agent.
5. The **OrderItem** class represents an item within an order. It contains the selected menu item and the quantity ordered.
6. The **OrderStatus** enum represents the different statuses an order can have, such as PENDING, CONFIRMED, PREPARING, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY, DELIVERED, and CANCELLED.
7. The **DeliveryAgent** class represents a delivery agent who fulfills orders. It contains details such as ID, name, phone number, and availability status.
8. The **FoodDeliveryService** class is the main class that manages the food delivery service. It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the service exists. It provides methods to register customers, restaurants, and delivery agents, retrieve available restaurants and menus, place orders, update order status, cancel orders, and assign delivery agents to orders. It also handles notifications to customers, restaurants, and delivery agents.
