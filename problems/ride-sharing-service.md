# Designing a Ride-Sharing Service Like Uber

## Requirements
1. The ride sharing service should allow passengers to request rides and drivers to accept and fulfill those ride requests.
2. Passengers should be able to specify their pickup location, destination, and desired ride type (e.g., regular, premium).
3. Drivers should be able to see available ride requests and choose to accept or decline them.
4. The system should match ride requests with available drivers based on proximity and other factors.
5. The system should calculate the fare for each ride based on distance, time, and ride type.
6. The system should handle payments and process transactions between passengers and drivers.
7. The system should provide real-time tracking of ongoing rides and notify passengers and drivers about ride status updates.
8. The system should handle concurrent requests and ensure data consistency.

## Classes, Interfaces and Enumerations
1. The **Passenger** class represents a passenger in the ride sharing service, with properties such as ID, name, contact information, and location.
2. The **Driver** class represents a driver in the ride sharing service, with properties such as ID, name, contact information, license plate, location, and status (available or busy).
3. The **Ride** class represents a ride requested by a passenger and accepted by a driver, with properties such as ID, passenger, driver, source location, destination location, status, and fare.
4. The **Location** class represents a geographical location with latitude and longitude coordinates.
5. The **Payment** class represents a payment made for a ride, with properties such as ID, ride, amount, and payment status.
6. The **RideService** class is the main class that manages the ride sharing service. It follows the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the service exists.
7. The RideService class provides methods for adding passengers and drivers, requesting rides, accepting rides, starting rides, completing rides, and canceling rides.
8. Multi-threading is implemented using concurrent data structures (ConcurrentHashMap and ConcurrentLinkedQueue) to handle concurrent access to shared data, such as ride requests and driver availability.
9. The notifyDrivers, notifyPassenger, and notifyDriver methods are placeholders for notifying relevant parties about ride status updates.
10. The calculateFare and processPayment methods are placeholders for calculating ride fares and processing payments, respectively.
11. The **RideSharingDemo** class demonstrates the usage of the ride sharing service by creating passengers and drivers, requesting rides, accepting rides, starting rides, completing rides, and canceling rides.
